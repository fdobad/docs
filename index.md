Welcome to the Fire2a research group documentation, choose your component:

[__Cell2Fire++__](docs/Cell2Fire/README.html): Forest fire simulator ([Forked]) and improved ([NowHere]): supports different fuel models, calculates a variety novel of metrics, deals with surface and vegetation moisture content; also enhancements in memory management, platform support, etc...)

[__QGIS Processing-Toolbox-plugin__](docs/qgis-toolbox/README.html): Next step: Clusterize your results, get firebreak placement recomendations, and more. A [QGIS] processing plugin to socialize our research.

[__Algorithms Library__](docs/fire2a-lib.html): A python package to common tasks & patterns of GIS. Also showcasing proof of concepts and special algorithms developed such as landscape clustering, firebreak optimization allocation, downstream protection value, etc...

[__QGIS Cookbook__](docs/qgis-cookbook/README.html): Install & Setup python environments, plugins and workflows...

[__QGIS Dialog-plugin__](docs/qgis-dialog/README.html): Simulate forest fires, get valuable metrics, in a user friendly graphical interface through [QGIS]. __Not maintained__, _graphical users should use the Processing-Toolbox._

# About us

We are a research group that seeks solutions to complex problems arising from the terrestrial ecosystem and its natural and anthropogenic disturbances, such as wildfires.

Currently hosted at [ISCI](https://isci.cl) offices.
